Supported operations include: add, subtract, multiply, divide, and power.

## How It Works
- The user selects an operation (1–5).
- The program reads two numbers.
- A matching function runs the calculation.
- The result prints in the format “a + b = c”.
- Division is protected against dividing by zero.
- The Power function reuses the Multiply function as requested in the instructions.
