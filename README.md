# C# Programming Repository  
**Author:** Joe Goode  
**Course:** C# Programming

## Overview
This repository contains all of my work for Robertson College's **C# Programming** course. The goal of this repo is to keep everything organized in one place while I work through weekly activities and graded assignments.

Each folder represents a different part of the course, and new items will be added as the course continues.

## Folder Structure

### Activities/
This folder includes the smaller practice tasks from the course.  
Each activity has its own project folder and focuses on one or two basic concepts such as:
- variables  
- user input  
- calculations  
- conditionals  
- loops  
- simple functions  

### Assignments/
This folder contains the larger, graded assignments.  
Each assignment has its own project and follows the instructions from the weekly modules.
